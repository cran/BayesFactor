  include1 = TRUE,
  addDenom = FALSE,
  sortbf = TRUE,
  logbase = c("log10", "log2", "ln"),

\arguments{
\item{x}{a BFBayesFactor object}

\item{include1}{if \code{TRUE}, ensure that Bayes factor = 1 is on the plot}

\item{addDenom}{if \code{TRUE}, add the denominator model into the group}

\item{sortbf}{sort the Bayes factors before plotting them? Defaults to
\code{TRUE}}

\item{logbase}{the base of the log Bayes factors in the plot}

\item{marginExpand}{an expansion factor for the left margin, in case more
space is needed for model names}

\item{cols}{a vector of length two of valid color names or numbers}

\item{main}{a character vector for the plot title}

\item{pars}{a list of par() settings}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to barplot()}

\description{
Plot a Bayes factor object
}
\details{
This function creates a barplot of the (log) Bayes factors in a Bayes factor
object. Error bars are added (though in many cases they may be too small to
see) in red to show the error in estimation of the Bayes factor. If a red question mark
appears next to a bar, then that Bayes factor has no error estimate available.

bfs = anovaBF(RT ~ shape*color + ID, data = puzzles, whichRandom="ID", progress=FALSE)
