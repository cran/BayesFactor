  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.6

CHANGES
  *  Fixed a bug causing Bayes factors to evaluate to NA when matrix inversion fails (very rare)
  *  Fixed a bug causing computation to fail if importance sampling fails in nWayAOV. Uses method="simple" as a fallback.

  *  Data frame for linear model analyses now get modified: character columns are converted to factors, and factors are re-factor()ed to get rid of levels with no observations
  * Increased prior scales in one-sample t test by a factor of sqrt(2), in order to be consistent with the two-sample t test for the same effect size and effective sample size

  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.5

CHANGES
  *  Minor bug fixes
  *  Changed back to new R 3.0 vignette building (and moved files to vignettes directory)
  *  Restricted to R >= 3.0.0

  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.4

CHANGES
  *  Fixed bug in sampling of posteriors in linear models
  *  Fixed bug computing the Bayes factor of unbalanced one-way ANOVA with two levels - caused function to fail
  *  Fixed occasional problem where optimization for the importance sampler would fail, giving a numerically singular matrix
  *  Fixed problem where extremely rare large or small g values from the sampler would cause the Bayes factor to be NA (again, creating a singular numerically singular matrix). These very rare samples are now disregarded.
  *  Added global option to turn progress bars on or off; use options(BFprogress = TRUE) or options(BFprogress = FALSE)
  *  Added MCMC chain thinning to nWayAOV - to use, pass "thin" argument to posterior() or lmBF()
  *  Added MCMC chain column filtering, useful for low memory systems. To use, pass "columnFilter" argument to posterior() or lmBF(). See the help for posterior() for more details.
  *  Added function generalTestBF(), which allows testing of restrictions on a full model in a manner similar to regressionBF() and anovaBF().
  *  Added "noSample" argument to many functions. These will disable time-consuming sampling, and return an object of the same structure as if sampling had been done. This allows for the culling of BayesFactor objects and preplanning chain analyses before sampling
  *  Added is.na() method for BFBayesFactor objects. When combined with recompute() and noSample (see above), this allows one to create lists of models with missing Bayes factors, remove uninteresting models, then recompute only the missing ones

  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.3

CHANGES
  *  Restricted to R 3.0.0 (due to vignette compilation).


  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.2

CHANGES
  *  Full support for linear models: continuous and categorical covariates can now be included in the same model using lmBF()
  *  Minor changes to the BayesFactor output to make it clearer
  *  Fixed display of very large and very small Bayes factors; no longer will display read something like "Inf (2%)" or the like
  *  Clearer labels on MCMC output
  *  When error is missing from the BayesFactor object, plot prints "?" next to the bar to indicate no error estimate is available
  *  Default prior scale setting changed for continuous covariates; scale now defaults to sqrt(2)/4, which corresponds to the ANOVA "medium" setting (and will give the same Bayes factor in special cases where they should)
  *  Default prior scale setting in one-sample t changed to 1/2 (it was erroneously changed to sqrt(2)/2). Two-sample t test default setting remains the same, at sqrt(2)/2
  *  Added new prior scale settings for random effects; default to "nuisance", which is the same as the old default (r=1)
  *  New prior scale setting: "ultrawide"
  *  Fixed bug with BFManual() which caused it not to start if dynamic help had not been started yet
  *  When doing an Bayes factor analysis that requires sampling, the new default setting (method="auto") will automatically try to select the best sampler for you so that you get the most efficient samples.



  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.1

CHANGES
  *  Vignette compilation changed for compatibility with R 3.0.0


  CHANGES IN BayesFactor VERSION 0.9.0

CHANGES
  *  New S4 classes representing Bayes factors, models, and MCMC chains. The output of all functions will now be objects of these classes
  *  Error estimates are now given for all Bayes factor outputs
  *  To accomodate the new system for creating and manipulating Bayes factors, the main function names have all changed. ANOVA is done via anovaBF(), multiple regression is done via regressionBF() and both can be done through lmBF()
  *  Posterior sampling is supported by calling the new posterior() method on Bayes factor objects. The result is an BayesFactor MCMC object, which inherits methods for for mcmc objects from the coda class
  *  New recompute() method will allow the reestimation of Bayes factors (for Bayes factor objects) and restimation of posteriors (for BayesFactor MCMC objects)
  *  New cleaned-up code base
